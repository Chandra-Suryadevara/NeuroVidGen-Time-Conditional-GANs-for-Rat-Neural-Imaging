# NeuroVidGen-Time-Conditional-GANs-for-Rat-Neural-Imaging

**NeuroVidGen: cGANs for Rat Neural Imaging**  Utilizing cGANs to synthesize rat neural video data. Generates dynamic visualizations from time-stamped inputs, aiding neural dynamics understanding.

This repository contains code for generating synthetic rat behavioral data using a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN). The model takes rat video frames and associated timestamps to generate realistic behavioral sequences.

## Overview

The project focuses on:

- Creating synthetic rat behavioral data for research in neuroscience.
- Training a CGAN to understand and replicate rat behavior based on video frames.
- Providing tools for data preprocessing, model training, and data generation.

## Compatibility and Requirements

- Python 3.10.13
- TensorFlow 2.10.1 with CUDA support (verify compatibility with your OS)
- CUDA (compatible version for TensorFlow 2.10.1)
- Keras, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pillow
